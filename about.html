            <h1>About Dark Thunder Games</h1>
            <p><i>Dark Thunder Games</i> is a <strong>creative game development team founded</strong> in <strong>April 2022.</strong> Our mission is to craft <strong>fun and enjoyable games</strong> for players of all kinds.</p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Originally known as <i>Goofy Games Studios</i>, the team spent its early years developing games using <strong>Julians Editor</strong> and <strong>Scratch.</strong> During this time, we focused mainly on <strong>simple clicker games</strong> and <strong>short, humorous projects.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>In late 2023</strong>, we decided to take a new direction to improve the <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong> of our games. This led to a rebranding, and on <strong>June 17th, 2024</strong>, <i>Goofy Games Studios</i> officially became <strong>Dark Thunder Games.</strong></p>

            <p>Since then, weâ€™ve been dedicated to creating more <strong>polished</strong> and <strong>exciting gaming experiences</strong> for our community.</p>
